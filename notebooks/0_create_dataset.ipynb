       "when a French Jesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot, acquired a copy of\n",
       "it, and translated it into French. It was not a good translation because,\n",

       "and very little indeed of what he did.\"\n",

       "The first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by Capt. E.\n",
       "F. Calthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words of Dr. Giles,\n",
       "\"excessively bad.\" He goes further in this criticism: \"It is not merely a\n",
       "question of downright blunders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt.\n",
       "Omissions were frequent; hard passages were willfully distorted or slurred\n",
       "over. Such offenses are less pardonable. They would not be tolerated in any\n",

       "be insisted upon in translations from Chinese.\" In 1908 a new edition of Capt.\n",
       "Calthropâs translation was published in London. It was an improvement on the\n",
       "first—omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected—but new\n",
       "errors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his translation,\n",
       "wrote: \"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers;\n",
       "but I could not help feeling that Sun TzÅ­ deserved a better fate than had\n",

       "Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum.\n",
       "Apparently he wanted to produce a definitive edition, superior to anything else\n",
       "that existed and perhaps something that would become a standard translation. It\n",
       "was the best translation available for 50 years. But apparently there was not\n",
       "much interest in Sun TzÅ­ in English-speaking countries since it took the start\n",
       "of the Second World War to renew interest in his work. Several people published\n",
       "unsatisfactory English translations of Sun TzÅ­. In 1944, Dr. Gilesâ translation\n",
       "was edited and published in the United States in a series of military science\n",
       "books. But it wasnât until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\n",
       "Griffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to Gilesâ\n",

       "represents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of the text as\n",
       "possible. Because the 1910 text contains a Chinese concordance, I was able to\n",
       "transliterate proper names, books, and the like at the risk of making the text\n",
       "more obscure. However, the text, on the whole, is quite satisfactory for the\n",
